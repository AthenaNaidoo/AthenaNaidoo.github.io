        I'm havig a bit of a issue with understanding how 
        exactly GitHub is supposed to work, I really feel like 
        I am doing something wrong. 
        My intention with this website, I go into a bit more detail on the 
        portfolio page, is to make the user feel like they are on 
        an website from the old web. 
        In this weeks lecture the idea of ethics was brought up 
        in connection with UI. An idea that really stood out to 
        me in class was the idea that if you are really conscious 
        about the subcounscious behavior/ habits of your users
        you can manipulate them into interaction with your product int
        a way that could be benificial for your own gain. 
        This could also mean you are negatively affecting the user, which
        in the case of basic human decency, is undesireable. However in the 
        name of making a profit is a very powerful thig to understand.

    I enjoy the Html ascpect of building the website the most enjoyable and easy so far. 
    The styling part of the website tedious and confusing
    at times, I find myself confusing classes and such 
    but its a good learning experience. I have been keeping a log 
    of all the problems that I've incountered while working on the website and
    most of the time the issues have to do with styling.
    I don't think my 
    wireframes are entiretly user friendly at the moment
    because they are really just very rough ideas.

    This week we have been introduced to CSS. I find it really interesting
    that websites are made up of so many diffrent interlinked parts. 
    Its like how the internet itself is made up of many diffrent things
    that are linked together to create this amazing web 
    of human knowlege and experience. <details><img src="/images/Internet_map_1024.jpg" alt="" class="InternetPic"></details>
    
    THe video on bad doors was really intresting because 
    it highlights the idea that as a designer you should be 
    making things with the intetion that it will be used 
    by humans. It's also intresting because as of recently 
    I've actually begun to think about certain products and how they 
    have been made without actual functionality in mind. A recent example
    that comes to mind is that I was trying to connect something to 
    the Tv via the HTML port and it was if the TV's design was meant
    to make it impossible to do, the port itself was in the most inaccessible
    place possible and it was really frustrating.

    Going throught the HTML exercise, I'm somewhat surprised
    because it seems pretty simple (I say this now and then struggle), everything
    makes sense and while I know all coding is supposed to be "logical" and make sense
    it really doesn't most of the time, at least in my experience. 
    So far its actually fun to be able to see the thing you want to build
    come into being in real time. 



    <details>I wanted to quickly reflect on the readings week 1:
        I read Garden of Forking Paths, The Libary of Babel and
        As we may think. 
        I really enjoyed Libary of Babel it reminded me of one of 
        my all time favorite works of sci-fi; a short
        story titled The Machine Stops by E. M. Foster, I highly 
        recommend everyone reads it. It also reminded me of the existence of 
        <a href="https://libraryofbabel.info/" target="_blank">this website</a> 
        which I stumbled upon a few years ago. I also really enjoyed the 
        Garden of Forking Paths. I found As we may think to be a bit difficult to
        read at times but it was really intresting to see a reasonable 
        imagining of what the future's technology may look like.

       Setting up GitHub seemed easy enough if not a tiny bit confusing.
       I'm not really sure how to use it properly yet but hopefully with some time I 
       will figure it out. I've watched a few youtube videos on it which kinda helped. 

        My personal goal for this course is to become more comfortable
        coding. It's something I really want to be able to do. I also what to 
        learn more about the internet and how to create. 

        We were asked in class to keep track of how often we went onto the internet 
        that day. While I didn't stricly keep track, I estimate that daily I spend 
        about 6 hours online or interacting with the internet 
        a day. I spend most of my free time either doom scrolling
        on some time sucking social media platform or I spend it going down various 
        internet rabbit holes for enjoyment. I also do other things like stream music,
        watch stuff on netflix and most of the work I have to do for university requires 
        me to be online in some capacity.
